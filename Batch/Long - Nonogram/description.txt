Nonogram is a solitaire game played on a n × m grid, where each cell has to be painted either black or white. Every row (and column) has a list of integer numbers, which correspond to the lengths of the runs of black squares in that row (or column), in order.

For instance, this is an example of solved nonogram:


Please write a program to solve nonograms.

Input

Test case begins with a line with n and m, followed by n lines with the numbers of the i-th row, followed by m lines with the numbers of the j-th column. The first number from each line represent the number of numbers trailing. Assume 1 ≤ n ≤ 15. Every given nonogram has exactly one solution.

Output

For every case, print the solution of the nonogram.
